# ESP8266-Switch

Software to control ESP8266 based switch.
The switch registers to your wifi network. It can then be adressed by a few REST-services.

Issues: 
- For each switch the software must be compiled individualy because all the switch and connection details are hard coded.
- No documentation yet
- Software is completely in dutch language
